The electricual buzz # 2 can be used when the system is being broken
Mind numbing... can be used as the base noise for the transformer that stops when the system is broken
We will need a click for the curcuit breaker flipping
Circuit Breaker humming with heavy load has a lot of background noise and I don't know that we will really be able to use this audio in our game but it is a good example of what noises we could make for the breaker.
