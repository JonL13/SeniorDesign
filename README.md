# Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) Substation Simulator - Senior Design Project
This is the collaboration forum for senior's participating in the EPRI substation simulator project. This project combines electrical characteristics, with physical assets, using 3D modeling and software programming tools. In particular this project uses Blender for object creation, and Unity for the development environment. 
The substation has a perimeter, a control house, and various assets such as transformers. When a failure occurs the operator can go into the control house, isolate the equipment so repairs can occur, then re-energize the equipemnt via the same control house. 

Check the Wiki for instructions and guidelines on using Github with Unity for this project.
