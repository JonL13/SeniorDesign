# University of Tennessee Substation Simulator - Senior Design Project
This is the collaboration forum for senior's participating in the substation simulator project. This project combines electrical characteristics, with physical assets, using 3D modeling and software programming tools. In particular this project uses Blender for object creation, and Unity for the development environment. 
The substation has a perimeter, a control house, and various assets such as transformers. When a failure occurs the operator can go into the control house, isolate the equipment so repairs can occur, then re-energize the equipemnt via the same control house. 

Check the Wiki for instructions and guidelines on using Github with Unity for this project.

This project was suggested and mentored by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) however, the code and features are created and maintained by UT students as part of their senior projects. The goal is to have the project added to each year, by new student teams to have a simulator that is both fun and educational; that looks like a real substations in terms of objects and electrical behaviors.
